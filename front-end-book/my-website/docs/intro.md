# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials

Welcome to the beginner-friendly textbook for understanding ROS 2 and humanoid robotics!

## About This Textbook

This textbook provides a concept-first approach to learning ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and its applications in humanoid robotics. No prior robotics experience required!

## Available Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System – ROS 2

Learn the foundations of ROS 2 through three comprehensive chapters:

1. **[ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System](module1/chapter1.md)** - Understand what ROS 2 is and how it enables modular robot control
2. **[ROS 2 Communication Primitives](module1/chapter2.md)** - Master nodes, topics, services, and Python (rclpy) basics
3. **[Humanoid Robot Description with URDF](module1/chapter3.md)** - Learn how to describe robot structure using URDF

## Learning Approach

- **Concept-first**: Focus on understanding "why" before "how"
- **Beginner-friendly**: Plain language explanations with minimal jargon
- **Visual aids**: Diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
- **Self-contained**: Each chapter can be read independently
